Here's some of my bash scripts I use.

andy.sh - pings an address and gives a thumbs up/thumbs down based on the result. I use this to see what network my kid's computer is on.

Bar.sh and temp.sh are used with a weather station and weather display console's clientraw files to pull the current temp/baro and give an arrow indicating the trend.

ipcam.sh just moves some files on a server.

pingtest.sh pings and address and returns the response in a nice clean format for status bars.

vm_windows is just a script to open a vm.
