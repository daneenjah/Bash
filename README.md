Here's some of my bash scripts I use.

*andy.sh* - pings an address and gives a thumbs up/thumbs down based on the result. I use this to see what network my kid's computer is on.

*background.sh* - changes my i3 background.

*bar.sh and temp.sh* - are used with a weather station and weather display console's clientraw files to pull the current temp/baro and give an arrow indicating the trend.

*gpu.sh* - sets my video card power limit to max.

*ipcam.sh* - just moves some files on a server.

*logs.sh* - cleans up logs directory. Useful on low memory machines.

*music.sh* - randomly picks a line of text from a file, good for piping into a music player.

*pingtest.sh* - pings and address and returns the response in a nice clean format for status bars.

*vm_windows* - is just a script to open a vm.

*weather* - a weather script for polybar.
